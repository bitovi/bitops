# About

---------------------
## How BitOps works

BitOps is a boiler plate docker image for DevOps work. An operations repository is mounted to a bitops image's `/opt/bitops_deployment` directory. BitOps will

* Auto-detect any configuration belonging to one of its [supported tools](#supported-tools)
* Loop through each tool and
    * Run any pre-execute hooks
    * Read in `yaml` configuration
    * Execute the tool
    * Run any post-execute hooks

## Run BitOps
BitOps is packaged as a docker image and is available on [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitovi/bitops).
```
docker pull bitovi/bitops
cd $YOUR_OPERATIONS_REPO
docker run bitovi/bitops -v $(pwd):/opt/bitops_deployment
```

## Configure BitOps

BitOps is configured in 3 steps:
