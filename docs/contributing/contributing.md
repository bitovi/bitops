# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

When you are ready to get started developing, see our [development guide](development.md) for how to get started!

## Developer Certificate of Origin ##

To contribute to this project, you must agree to the Developer Certificate of
Origin (DCO) for each commit you make. The DCO is a simple statement that you,
as a contributor, have the legal right to make the contribution.

See the [DCO](DCO.md) file for the full text of what you must agree to.

To signify that you agree to the DCO for a commit, you add a line to the git
commit message:

```txt
Signed-off-by: Jane Smith <jane.smith@example.com>
```

In most cases, you can add this signoff to your commit automatically with the
`-s` flag to `git commit`. You must use your real name and a reachable email
address (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions).

Code reviews
All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose.
