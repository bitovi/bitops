BitOps is a way to describe the infrastructure and things deployed onto that infrastructure for multiple environments in a single place called an [Operations Repo](operations-repo-structure.md).

---------------------

## Features

* **[Configurable](configuration-base.md):** Configure how you want bitops to deploy your application with environment variables or yaml
* **[Event Hooks](lifecycle.md):** If bitops doesn't have built-in support for your usecase, execute arbitrary bash scripts at different points in bitops' lifecycle.
* **[Run Anywhere](examples.md):** By bundling all logic in bitops, you can have the same experience regardless of which pipeline service runs your CI. You can even run bitops locally!

## How it works

BitOps is a boiler plate docker image for DevOps work. An operations repository is mounted to a bitops image's `/opt/bitops_deployment` directory. BitOps will

* Auto-detect any configuration belonging to one of its [supported tools](#supported-tools)
* Loop through each tool and
    * Run any pre-execute hooks
    * Read in `yml` configuration
    * Execute the tool
    * Run any post-execute hooks

## Run BitOps
BitOps is packaged as a docker image and is available on [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitovi/bitops).
```
docker pull bitovi/bitops
cd $YOUR_OPERATIONS_REPO
docker run bitovi/bitops -v $(pwd):/opt/bitops_deployment
```

## Configure BitOps

BitOps is configured in 3 steps:

1. Select your environment
2. Configure aceess to your cloud provider
3. Configure how you want your deployment tools to execute
